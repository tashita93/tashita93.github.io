projectTitle: SMARTSTAFF APP
projectDescription:
  - The Smartstaff work app is India's first platform dedicated to addressing the needs of blue-collar workers. From managing shifts and understanding payouts to accessing advance salaries, insurance, and community-building games, it empowers workers to navigate their work lives with confidence and dignity. In an industry once marked by exploitation, Smartstaff has brought regulation, transparency, and fairness to the forefront.
  - I had the privilege of being the sole designer for this experience. With embedded audio files, multi-language support, simplified payout details, and more, I built, rebuilt, and refined a platform that has now transformed the lives of over 40,000 workers. This wasn't just about designâ€”it was about creating real change where it mattered most.
