projectTitle: INTERNATIONAL TENNIS HALL OF FAME
projectDescription: 
  - For a collaborative project with Infosys and the International Tennis Hall of Fame, I created animations that explore innovation and the future of tennis. Infosys, a global leader in digital services, partnered with the ITHF to unveil new immersive, digital experiences at the Infosys Hall of Fame Open in Newport, R.I. The project also introduced an exciting roadmap of innovations in the metaverse.
  - My illustrations for this project blended the latest technological advancements with the rich heritage of the sport, creating a dynamic visual experience that resonated with both the past and the future of tennis.
