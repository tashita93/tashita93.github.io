projectTitle: SMARTSTAFF BRANDING
projectDescription:
  - The manufacturing industry in India has long been plagued by unregulated practices, disorganized workforce management, and systems that haven't seen innovation in decades. That's where Smartstaff stepped inâ€”with a mission to streamline operations for manufacturing giants.
  - I was entrusted with creating Smartstaff's visual brand identity. My design reflects the platform's commitment to helping companies efficiently source, manage, and retain their workforce, addressing industry challenges with clarity and impact. Through thoughtfully crafted visual language, I positioned Smartstaff as an innovative and reliable partner that not only empowers businesses but also honours the vital contributions of their workforce.
