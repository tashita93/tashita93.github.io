projectTitle: BRAND ARCHETYPE EXPERIENCE
projectDescription:
  - Brand Archetypes Experience, or BAE, began as a publication project and later expanded into a workshop. It was created to help brands understand and leverage their archetypes for better communication and decision-making.
  - The book *The Maha Brand Katha* was designed with a distinctly Indian touch, inspired by the Mahabharata, known for its rich array of characters and stories. Twelve characters from the epic were mapped to the twelve archetypes and then to brand personalities. The book's visual identity, inspired by the Disney game *Crossy Road*, uses bold colors, typography, and illustrations to capture the epicâ€™s vibrancy.
  - The BAE workshop enabled brands like Intuit and xto10x to explore their archetypes deeply through exercises and games, uncovering nuances to inspire creative strategies.
